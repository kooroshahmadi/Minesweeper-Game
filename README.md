# Minesweeper-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python's Tkinter library. The game features a grid of cells, some of which are randomly assigned as mines. The player must click on cells to reveal them, trying to avoid clicking on mines. The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.
